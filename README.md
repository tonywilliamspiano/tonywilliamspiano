My name is Tony and I'm a jazz musician and software engineer. After a 10-year career in music, I decided it was time for a change and fell in love with all things coding. 

### My Passions

- Solving problems, working on difficult projects and helping people.
- Reading, learning and broadening my horizons every day.
- Fostering a strong sense of community where people feel heard, welcome and productive.


### My Dream

- I want to combine music and technology to create solutions that musicians really need and want. I want to find ways to give talented artists the freedom to express themselves creatively and make a good living doing it.


### My Projects

[Interactive Music Interface](https://hagelslag.band/siehst_du/index.html)
- I wrote this piece as part of my music studies and coded it in 2023. The idea is to give non-musicians the experience of being an arranger / music producer.

### Non-Coding Projects

[Hidden Jams](https://hidden-jams.de/)
- We're bringing international artists to Germany to record live videos with the Hanover music community. Stay tuned in 2024, the videos are going to be great!
